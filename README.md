# Task-2-
I retrieved the sales data from Kaggle, a platform renowned for its vast datasets, 
where I meticulously conducted data profiling to gain a comprehensive understanding
of the information. Subsequently, I seamlessly imported the dataset into Power BI, 
a powerful data visualization tool, to craft and visualize essential key performance 
indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, units sold, total cost, and total profits. 
Leveraging the dynamic capabilities of Power BI, I adeptly integrated various types 
of graphs, including column charts, pie charts, funnel charts, and an interactive
map to geographically display the distribution of products and identify regional 
sales patterns. Furthermore, I thoughtfully designed a detailed table that prominently 
featured the products with the highest profit margins, highlighting the key drivers 
f success. This analytical journey provided me with a wealth of valuable insights, 
enabling me to delve deeper into the performance metrics with a keen focus on 
maximizing profits and optimizing business strategies.
